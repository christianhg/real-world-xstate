# Real-World XState

A collection of real-world problems and how you can solve them with [XState](https://xstate.js.org/).

Feel free to contribute with examples ‚ù§Ô∏è

The examples don't have to be copy/paste from an existing project. In fact, they should probably be distilled to a proof of concept/demo version. The main purpose is to share knowledge and experiences with orchestrating logic using state machines and statecharts.

You might also be interested in [xstate-catalogue.com](https://xstate-catalogue.com/) for a more official and generic collection of examples.

## Examples

### üí¨ Collecting Feedback

A pure-UI feedback form driven by a state machine.

### üîî Off-Screen Notification

On a page with a long-running process, we needed to show a notification to the user if the process finished off-screen. The result is a statechart that gets notified of the completion of the process as well as its visibility. The visibility is tracked using a spawned child machine that invokes an `IntersectionObserver`.
